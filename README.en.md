### 💧 About the Project

**SIF** enables monitoring and configuration of an irrigation system via the internet, aiming to make the process as precise and automated as possible. Created with a focus on **family farming**, this project seeks to bring accessible technology to rural producers.

Originally built in pure PHP, the project was upgraded to **Laravel** to simplify deployment and long-term maintenance.

🏆 **Awarded 1st Place in the Agricultural Sciences category at FI Ciências 2024**, one of the largest science fairs in Latin America.
